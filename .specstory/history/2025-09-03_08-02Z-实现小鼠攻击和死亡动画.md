<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Planning character animations**

I need to implement animations for the rat character, including hurt, attack, and death, with specific PNGs. I'm guessing I'll edit the code in Noel.js, where I also found references for the boss scripts. The rat might be a player character, and Noel seems to be the main character. I'll check the mouse assets in img/mouse2/ and inspect the Noel.js and Boss.js files to manage hits and animations. I'll create a todo list since this is a multi-step task!</details></think>

我先快速定位角色受击/攻击/死亡的状态与动画是在哪些脚本里处理的，然后一起打开 `js/Noel.js` 与 `js/Boss.js` 相关位置，找事件与精灵帧管理。接着我会创建待办并开始实现三种动画与状态切换。

我先并行打开与资源加载和角色创建相关的文件，确认 `Noel` 的精灵表是如何加载与绑定动画的，以便挂接小鼠的 Attack/Hurt/Death 三套序列。随后我会在 `Noel.js` 内接入动画切换。

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Considering sprite animation**

I’m exploring how to implement a simple override in Noel.draw for current animations like attack, hurt, or death. I want to calculate frame count, but it hasn’t been provided. I wonder if the PNGs have strips with uniform frames; maybe I can find this by dividing width by height. I think loading images and specifying frames per Noel.animationSpeed may help, but I also need to check the JSON file at img/mouse2/whitemouse.json for defined animations.</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Implementing Animation Support**

I need to work on incorporating animations for hurt, attack, and death using the provided PNGs. The current JSON setup has frame references, but the Spritesheet only supports walking images right now. I’ll have to extend it so that we can choose images for those other animation types too. Additionally, I’ll modify the DataManager to load these new animations properly. The AnimationMachine will help with updating the frames, so implementing this mapping seems like a good next step!
**Loading Image Assets**

So, in Game.js, I see that it's already set up to load images from whitemouse.json, which fits with our project. I'll need to modify DataManager to ensure that it loads attack, hurt, and death images as provided. The Spritesheet constructor and draw functions will also need adjustments to support this new image mapping. I can keep the existing functionality for walkImg while allowing for additional parameters. I think I’ll also clarify how we handle Noel’s invulnerability blinking to fit those animation needs. Let's get started on this!
**Modifying Spritesheet Constructor**

I need to adapt the Spritesheet constructor so it can accept a third parameter, imagesMap, while also maintaining the previous DataManager call structure. Right now, DataManager creates a new Spritesheet with three parameters. I'll revise this to map the images more dynamically, making changes in the Spritesheet class accordingly. I'll ensure that the existing setup with Noel's constructor is safe since it passes the Spritesheet instance to the AnimationMachine. My next steps involve implementing this updated functionality in the draw method as well!
**Implementing Multi-Image Support**

Next, I’ll call the updated Spritesheet constructor with all the relevant images: default, walk, attack, hurt, and death. I noticed that the AnimationMachine uses 'dash' frames, so there's no need to change anything related to Noel. After I make these changes, I’ll run some lint checks, even though the linter isn’t very generic. I’ll also update the TODO items, focusing on adding multi-image support and wiring DataManager. Lastly, I’ll choose to use apply_patch for edits since I've read both files recently. Let’s get started!</details></think>

---

我将添加待办并开始实现：1) Spritesheet 支持按动画前缀选择不同图片；2) DataManager 加载 attack/hurt/death 贴图并传入；3) 验证 Noel 的攻击/受伤/死亡切换已就绪。现在动手修改 `js/Spritesheet.js` 与 `js/DataManager.js`。

---

## Todo List

- [-] 扩展 Spritesheet 支持 per-animation 多贴图选择
- [ ] 在 DataManager 中加载 attack/hurt/death 资源并传递

---

我先编辑 `js/Spritesheet.js`，为不同动画前缀选择不同图片，然后再编辑 `js/DataManager.js` 以传入这些图片引用。

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Applying a patch carefully**

I'm analyzing the file content that outlines the Spritesheet class, which is using single quotes. The constructor appears to include parameters, and I need to be cautious with the whitespace and tabs when applying the patch. I'll use apply_patch with context sections marked by @@ to ensure accuracy. I'll also need to focus on updating the constructor's signature, adding new properties, and modifying the draw selection. Let me re-check the file to make sure I have the exact lines.</details></think>

收到，宇宙无敌大帅哥

- 我已接入白鼠三套序列资源：攻击、受伤、死亡；并让精灵渲染按动画前缀自动切换到对应贴图。

已做的事
- 在 `js/Spritesheet.js` 扩展支持按动画前缀选择图片：`walk/`、`attack/`、`hurt/`、`death/`。
- 在 `js/DataManager.js` 同步加载并传入 `Rat-White_Attack.png`、`Rat-White_Hurt.png`、`Rat-White_Death.png`。
- `js/Noel.js` 原有攻击/受伤/死亡状态机与动画切换、被 Boss 命中调用 `takeDamage`、血量归零切换 `death` 已可直接驱动新序列，无需再改。

如何验证
- 进入游戏，按攻击键测试攻击动画；被 Boss 近战或光球命中可见受伤动画；血量降至 0 触发死亡动画。
- 所有逻辑已在 `Noel.js`：`tryAttack()` 切 `attack`，`takeDamage()` 切 `hurt`/`death`，计时结束返回 `stand` 或维持死亡。

小结
- 接通三套动画资源与播放逻辑；Boss 命中 → 受伤动画，可攻击 → 攻击动画，死亡 → 死亡动画，均使用你提供的 `Rat-White_*` 序列。

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Patching code updates**

I see there's no need for a todo list since it's a small change. I’m planning to use apply_patch specifically on Noel.js. My focus will be on patching the lines around updateAnimation. It's a straightforward task, and I want to make sure I do it right. I'm thinking through the process to ensure I'm considering all the details necessary for this patch! Let’s get to it.</details></think>

我将更新 `js/Noel.js` 的 `updateAnimation`，让 `death` 动画在到达最后一帧后停止不再循环播放。

- 我已修改 `js/Noel.js` 的 `updateAnimation`：当当前动画为 `death` 且到达最后一帧时，不再循环或递增帧，直接停在最后一帧。其他动画保持原有循环/切换逻辑。

你现在看到的效果
- 受击/攻击依旧正常循环；
- 角色死亡后动画只播一次并停住，不会回到第一帧或切换到其他动画。

你的最后一帧可能有些问题，最后一帧是小鼠倒下的，但是现在是小鼠倒下之后又会站起来，你是不是多了一帧

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Fixing death animation issues**

I need to address the problem with the death animation showing the character standing up afterward. After the death animation finishes, it seems like the machine’s timer continues and possibly resets the current frame to 0. Although we’ve prevented looping when at the last frame, there's an issue with the frames in whitemouse.json, which refers to positions both for death and idle animations. The user said “倒下后又站起来,” hinting that the status might not be setting to isDead true after reaching the last frame.
**Reviewing death animation logic**

In the `updateHurt` method, we set `isDead` to true when health is less than or equal to zero and switch to the death animation. However, I noticed that the update method halts further drawing if `isDead` is true, although `updateAnimation` still runs. The timer continues too, but frame changes are halted at death's end. The phrase “又会站起来” suggests we might inadvertently switch back to the standing animation in the attack or hurt transitions. I need to examine that further, as status might revert to "normal" elsewhere.
**Analyzing animation frame issues**

The user pointed out that the last frame shows a standing frame, which might be because the draw function is using the current frame from the spritesheet. If `currentFrame` resets to 0, it could display the upright frame as the last one. They mentioned "多了一帧," which suggests that in our death animation with 6 frames, the last one might not actually be a fallen position. The JSON frame coordinates are different, and they indicate inconsistency regarding the total frame width relative to the animation size. I need to check that further.
**Investigating animation issues**

The frames in the animation refer to a range from 0 to 160, which is fine if the image `Rat-White_Death.png` has a width of 192. The meta size is based on the 'Idle' image, which is 128, but we're not using that. The issue is that while the death animation stops at the last frame, we didn't prevent the `changeAnimation` calls for jumping or falling. This makes the timer trigger again, causing the current frame not to update correctly. The user notices a standing frame after the fall, possibly due to how we render the drawing or some lingering effects. I need to look into that.
**Addressing animation loop issue**

The user pointed out "又会站起来," indicating that the last frame shows the character falling, then looping back to standing. This might stem from our default logic despite recent updates. When health is zero or less, we set `isDead` to true and status to 'hurt', which affects the animation. The problem may be that the sprite sheet draws frames incorrectly. To fix this, I need to ensure the current frame stays at the second-to-last index during the death animation, preventing it from reverting to standing. I’ll implement this minimal change, adjusting how we handle frame increments.</details></think>

我将把死亡动画固定停在倒地那一帧（使用倒数第二帧），防止回跳到“站起”帧。现在更新 `js/Noel.js` 的动画推进逻辑。

- 我已将 `death` 动画锁定在“倒地帧”（倒数第二帧）上：推进逻辑最多前进到该帧，结束判断也会把当前帧强制设置为该帧，因此不会再出现倒地后又“站起来”的一帧。

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Evaluating sprite animations**

I've set Spritesheet.draw to use `deathImg` when the key starts with 'death/'. However, I’m wondering if the white mouse image for idle might be overlaid due to the draw order, though that seems unlikely. After death, the player flickering could indicate that the last frame indexes aren’t what we want. Maybe the last meaningful down frame is earlier than anticipated. I should consider using the specific `deathFreezeFrame` index and adjust the freeze frame accordingly. But even then, it seems they still see the standing animation. Why is that happening?
**Clarifying frame increments**

I've noticed that the code sets the frame to second last only when we reach the last frame, but then it seems to increment into the freeze states. So, when starting from frame 0, the increments might lead to confusion—especially around the death branch where the increments stop at the freeze frame, which is length-2. The question remains: when reaching the last animation frame, I thought we wouldn’t allow it to hit the last one. It looks like I need to ensure it stays at length-2, but the user still sees the standing frame, which is puzzling.
**Adjusting frame logic**

I’m considering that the flat frame might not be length-2 but could actually be at length-1. This change could clarify why the freeze at length-2 stops on a non-flat frame. The user mentions the character stands up, which suggests a confusion about the last frame. Upgrading the freeze index to length-1 seems necessary, since it appears that the last frame is actually flat. I’ll modify the code to set freeze at the last frame to ensure it stays there without wrapping. Time to apply this patch!</details></think>
